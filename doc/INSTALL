Installation
============

 1. Unpack/unzip

    Unpack the downloaded zip package into the 'extension' directory of your
    eZ Publish installation.

 2. Activate extension

    Activate the extension by using the admin interface ( Setup -> Extensions ) or by
    prepending ezjscore to ActiveExtensions[] in settings/override/site.ini.append.php:

    [ExtensionSettings]
    ActiveExtensions[]=developer
    
    
 3. Override the kernel class eZTemplatesStatisticsReporter
    
    There are two way to override this class.
    1) You can directly modify 'config.php' under your install root directory.
       At the end of this file you can add below line;
       
       @include_once('extension/bysoftdeveloper/kernel/eztemplatesstatisticsreporter.php');
       
       I guess you already know what i am doing. just provide this class before autoload check that.
       
    2) Or the second way to override kernel function is :
       
       http://ezpedia.org/solution/overriding_kernel_classes_within_an_extension
       
       You can read it and do it by yourself.
       
    I recommend you use the first way, since it is very easy.
